Create a modern, responsive homepage for a dark-themed web design and social media agency called Sentinel Peak Solutions. 

Use clean HTML and CSS (prefer Tailwind but vanilla CSS is fine). Make sure to include:

- A glowing hero section with headline, subheadline, and CTA buttons
- A services grid with 3â€“4 cards
- An animated portfolio preview section
- A testimonials slider (static HTML for now is fine)
- Simple pricing cards (3 tiers)
- A strong dark footer with contact info and links

Keep the layout mobile-first, clean, and easy to customize.
